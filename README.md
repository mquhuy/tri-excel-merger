# Tri Excel merger

This is just a rough script I wrote for my friend, whose name is Tri, hence the project name.

## Instruction

Run it like how you'd run any python project. `Python 3.5+` is required.
- Required packages are in `requirements.txt`
- Put all input excel files into a subdir called `data`
- Run the script `python process.py`
- Result files are stored in `output` subdir.

*Note*: The script assumes that the month names are unique, so don't run data from, say, Nov 2021 and Nov 2022 in the same batch.
